# LimaWaktu

Introduction
Welcome to the repository of my final year project, Lima Waktu Application. This application is designed to assist Muslim children in learning and practicing the correct movements and readings associated with daily prayers, also known as Salah or Salat. It aims to provide an interactive and engaging platform that facilitates the learning process and helps children develop a strong foundation in Islamic prayer.

Features
The Muslim Kids Prayer Aid Application offers the following features:

Step-by-step Guidance: The application provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for each prayer movement, including standing, bowing, prostration, and sitting positions. It offers visual representations and textual instructions to ensure children understand and perform the actions accurately.

Audio Assistance: To aid in proper pronunciation and recitation of the prayers, the application provides audio recordings of the prayer readings. Children can listen to the recitations and follow along to improve their pronunciation and understanding of the verses.

Interactive Interface: The application offers an intuitive and interactive interface, specifically designed to engage young users. It incorporates visually appealing graphics, animations, and gamification elements to make the learning process enjoyable and memorable.

Prayer Time: Display prayer time (got some error, display for one location only which is Hulu Langat, Selangor)
